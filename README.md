### Description

A while ago I was developing a dart statistics program, unfortunualy sometime later I

stopped developing. But I already made an control to handle the dartboard.

It's not completly finished, I still have to add a dart throw animation

in it. But still I think it's ready for use.

Some features:

- Board is resizable

- all colors are adjustable

- all ring sizes are adjustable.

Throw dart:

- by mouse clicking on the board

- by entering the darts x,y location

- by entering the darts value.

I found it a waste of good programming to leave it on my computer without any use.

I hope some of you can use it in your own applications.

If someone can send me a good animation of a dart in flight,

I would appreciate it and I would put it in the control as well.
