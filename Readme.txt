Hi, to all who's reading this kind of files.

A while ago I was developing a dart statisticsprogram, but sometime later I
stopped developing. But I already made an control to handle the dartboard.
It's not completly finished, I still have to add a dart throw animation
in it. But still I think it's ready for use.

Some features:

- Board is resizable
- all colors are adjustable
- all ring sizes are adjustable

Throw dart:
- by mouse clicking on the board
- by entering the darts x,y location
- by entering the darts value

I found it a waste of good programming to leave it on my computer without any use.

I hope some of you can use it in your own applications.
If someone can send me a good animation of a dart in flight,
I would appreciate it and I would put it in the control as well.


Happy programming to you all.

p.s.
Remove the .txt from DartBoard.ocx.txt to use the control.
